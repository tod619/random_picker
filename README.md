# random_picker

## Description

Allows users to enter in different choices seperated by a ",". The choices are displayed under the textarea. Once the user hits the enter key each choice is highlighted and unhighlighted at random until the system picks a random tag and this tag remains highlighted.
This project inserts elements into the dom, and uses setTimeout and setInterval to higlight and unhighlight the different tags.
